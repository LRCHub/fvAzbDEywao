The blade I swing is black as night
Black as my soulless heart
It bears the burden of many lives
But I don't feel remorse
I lent my sword to anyone
Willing to pay the price
No regrets for what I've done
A mercenary's life
But there I was on battlegrounds
Until I felt the jaws of death cut into my flesh
Defending old and weak
But I did not retreat
Now, here I lie in my own blood
And strangers cry for me
I'm prepared to meet the Gods
I wish they'd let me be
I don't deserve their sympathy
I know who I am
My soul is death and misery
I am an evil man
I rest in my blood, soon I will face the Gods
Strangers cry for me, I wish they'd let me be
Show no sympathy, shed no tears for me
I know who I am, I am an evil man
I know who I am, I am an evil man
I know who I am, I am an evil man
I know who I am, I am an evil man
I know who I am, I am an evil man
