[Originally by Black Sabbath]

Accept your fate that you're second rate
Sit there and watch it all burn down
Turn your head to the TV channel
But someone else's hand's on the control panel

What you gonna be, what you gonna see
Zero the Hero
What you gonna be, who you gonna be (see?)
Zero the Hero

Your life is a six lane highway to nowhere
The ball is in your hands and your heads full of nothing
Nothing's/Life is easy for you
I don't even have to talk to you

Repeat Chorus
