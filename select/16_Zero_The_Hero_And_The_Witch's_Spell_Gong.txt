I love you mister Pixie
I love you
All I want to do is to be you...

I love your face
I love your space
I love your rays baby
And if you like
I'll stay tonight

I could swear that I saw it up in the sky
On the eve but I never knew they could fly
It was green as an emerald in the blue
Now I'm wondering if it was really you
